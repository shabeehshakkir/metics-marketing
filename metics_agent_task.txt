AGENT TASK: Build Metics Landing Page Content (Marketing + Use Cases)

ROLE
You are a content+frontend assistant working in a codebase with a simple static site (Next.js or React, or plain HTML). Your goal is to implement production‑ready copy blocks for the Metics landing page and provide structured assets (markdown/JSON) that engineers/designers can drop in.

OBJECTIVE
1) Create a single source of truth for the Metics landing page copy.
2) Provide ready-to-use sections (hero, value props, features, use cases, credibility, FAQs, CTA).
3) Include SEO metadata (title, meta description, OpenGraph/Twitter, JSON‑LD).
4) Provide content variants for short ad blurbs.
5) Keep tone: credible, construction‑industry, concise, benefit-led.

DELIVERABLES
- /content/metics_landing.md — full page copy with headings and CTA annotations.
- /content/metics_use_cases.md — detailed use cases as cards (title, audience, pain, solution, proof).
- /content/metics_faq.md — FAQs derived from platform behavior.
- /content/seo/metics_seo.json — SEO metadata + JSON-LD.
- /content/ads/metics_ads_blurbs.md — 8 short ad/LinkedIn post variants.
If you cannot create files, output them inline in this order with clear file name fences.

BRAND + TONE
- Audience: contractors, QS firms, developers/owners, SME suppliers, enterprise procurement.
- Voice: professional, practical, transparent. Avoid hype. Prefer action verbs. UK/EU spelling acceptable.
- Reading level: B2. Avoid jargon unless standard in procurement (RFQ, PO, Incoterms).

COPY STARTS BELOW — USE AS‑IS (you may lightly trim whitespace; do not rewrite meaning).
